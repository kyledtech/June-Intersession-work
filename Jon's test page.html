	<h2 class="center">Work Stuff</h2>
	<p class="justify">As a very exciting aside we successfuly were able to deploy our first game without a client release by writing the game logic in Lua using Moonsharp on the 
		client to intereret and execute the scripts. Being able to decouple a game release from a client release is huge in that it allows us to plan our releases a little more 
		flexibly. I can't say that I helped in getting that system going, but I can say that it will make my job a lot easier in the long run. Aside from that I've been working on 
		tools, migriting services from Google Cloud to Microsoft Azure, and getting an alert system running with our ElasticSearch cluster.  The last point is a big one for me and 
		I'll have the first version of this system rolled out this week if not the first day of Intercession.</p>

			After I got back to work right after the previous Intercession I talked to everybody about what we all did over our breaks. After sharing my experiences playing FF14 
			with friends from Turn 10 Studios (Forza Game Series) and YouTube (Endless Time Sink) I ended up getting a few people interested in joining us. At this point I've converted 4 
			coworkers to join the game, who then in turn talked 5 of their friends into hopping back into the adventure.  It's been really awesome just to be in the same voice chat 
			with as many people playing the same game again. The last time I played with so many people at once that I knew was 9 years ago, so it's been pretty lovely.

			Aside from 14 I've been playing Apex Legends off and on since it's a really well done game. On the other side of the coin I also played Anthem which was a pile of garbage 
			due to poor loot systems, a boring world, and a truly atrocious single player town experience. If I had time I would join some friends in playing The Division 2 but I can't 
			justify spending the money when I don't have the time to play games in general.

			I haven't been able to watch much in the way of anime this season due to work, driving around for college stuff, and standard housework that I've been working on in the 
			past few months.  When I have had time I've been watching Rise of the Shield Hero primarily because it's amazing despite being another Isekai anime. Aside from that I've 
			occassionaly been watching some Slime Reincarnation show that's been slowing down as well as the latest Sword Art Online here and there when I'm caught up on the other two.
