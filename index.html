                        <p>Over the past three intercessions, I have learned a plentiful amount on web design 
                       and many different aspects of life a normal high school would not teach. I think that this 
                       class has been really helpful in introducing computer science. Not only have I gained knowledge
                       on HTML and CSS, but I now have also gained interest in C# through exploring during personal time. </p>

                    Design Tech High School (d.tech) is a pioneering California public charter high school. Oracle’s relationship with d.tech began in 2014 through the Oracle Education Foundation, and quickly grew and deepened into the company building a home for the school on Oracle’s headquarters campus.
